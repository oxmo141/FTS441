        <p>
         Formula SAE (FSAE) is a intercollegiate competitions held by Society of Automotive Engineers 
         (SAE) International, where universities design, manufacture, build and race formula-style race cars. 
          Each car will be judged on its design, cost, efficiency, and performance through a series of dynamic 
          and static events, as well as its compliance with safety during technical inspection. Team members 
          will also be judged on their capabilities in team management, design thinking, technical knowledge, 
          and engineering practices.

          R26e has a total of 27 members from various departments. The team is mainly split into 2 core principals, Powertrain
          and Chassis. Each principal is further divided into departments that focus on specific areas of the car's design.

        <p>
          R25e achieved the highest overall standing of 7th place in the 2025 Formula SAE Electric competition held in
          Michigan, USA. We were able to secure top 10th position in most events, which demonstrated the car's well-rounded
          performance. However, there were areas for improvement, particularly in the dynamic events, where we
          faced challenges with handling and reliability. One of the main issues identified was the car's
          battery management system (BMS), which had overheating issues during all testing and competition runs.
          This not only affected the car's performance but also raised safety concerns. Additionally, the handling
          characteristics of the car were not optimal, leading to repeated oversteer.

        <p>
          The Team Goal for the R26e season is to reduce the average lap time in the Endurance event by 10% through
          improved reliability. To support this goal, the V.D. Suspension department has set a specific objective to enhance 
          the car's handling characteristics. To better understand the handling issues, a comprehensive vehicle dynamics analysis 
          will be conducted on the R25e competition and testing data. The analysis will focus on identifying the root causes of the 
          handling problems.

              subtitle="Image 4: skidpad layout (Powercat Motorsports, n.d.)"></image-component><br>
              <p> 
                The goal of the Skid Pad event is to measure the vehicle’s maximum cornering capability by measuring the total 
                time required for the vehicle to complete one left hand and one right hand circle.  The event is designed to 
                focus on the vehicle’s suspension design characteristics and tune-ability for maximum lateral grip and minimise 
                the effect of driver reflexes during transitional manoeuvres (Goslawski, Snyder, 2023).

              <p> 
                Skidpad performance can be evaluated on the G-G plot of the vehicle's lateral acceleration 
                against longitudinal acceleration during the event. The skidpad tests the vehicle's steady-state cornering
                capabilities, which is represented by minimal variance in lateral acceleration throughout the run. From the G-G 
                plot above from the competition skidpad, it is evident that the vehicle experienced significant fluctuations in 
                lateral acceleration during, both the left and right. This indicates that the vehicle was unable to maintain a 
                consistent cornering force, loosing lap time potential and indicating handling issues.

        <div id="Steering Feedback Analysis">
              <h4>1.3.2. Steering Feedback Analysis</h4>
              <p> 
                Steering feedback is a critical aspect of vehicle handling, as it provides the driver with information 
                about the limit of grip and the vehicle's behaviour during cornering. However, too much feedback can lead to
                driver fatigue and reduced control over the vehicle. In the case of R25e, drivers reported excessive steering 
                feedback during slow speed manoeuvres, which could be attributed to the suspension geometry and setup. Some
                complains included: the steering felt heavy at low speeds, making it difficult to navigate tight corners;
                after half my Endurance stint, my arms were exhausted from fighting the steering wheel; the car was difficult to
                control after extensive turning, leading to understeer and loss of control.

              <p>
                Image 6 represents the driver evaluation done in Singapore before competition. Driver evaluation is a crucial
                test to decide the best driver for the endurance event, 11km of continuous driving. This data is taken from
                the driver chosen for endurance event. The plot above shows the relationship between steering angle and vehicle 
                speed. The scatter plot in red and the corresponding red bar is his fastest lap, while the other scatter points represent 3 of his slower laps
                that occurred in the second half of his stint. From the plot, it is evident that he is consistently steering under
                the optimal steering range. This indicates that the driver is unable to exert optimal steering inputs to the car.
              </p>

              <p>
                To understand the full extent of the driver's struggle, we can also look at the relationship between 
                brake pressure and vehicle speed. Similarly, the scatter plot in red represents his fastest lap, while 
                the other scatter points represent 3 laps with fast lap times, which occurred in the start of his stint.
                From the plot, it is evident that the driver was able to apply consistent brake pressure inputs, demonstrating
                assets of a skilled endurance driver.
              </p>

              <p> 
                Now comparing with the scatter plots from his slower laps in the second half of his stint, we can see a
                significant increase in the variance of brake pressure inputs at irregular vehicle speeds. This indicates that
                the driver was struggling to make precise brake inputs, likely due to poor judgment as a result of fatigue.

      <div id="The Problem Statement">
        <h3>1.4. The Problem Statement</h3>
        <p>
          The skidpad performance is inconsistent, with significant fluctuations in lateral acceleration during 
          cornering. Moreover, the lack of driver's authority over the car has induced high driver fatigue, 
          resulting in poor decision making and inconsistent lap times during the endurance event. 
          This has been identified as critical issues that needs to be addressed to improve the overall performance 
          of the vehicle.

        <h2>2. Suspension Design Optimisation</h2>
        <p>
          Dynamic behaviour of a vehicle can be described by 2 main terms: Roadholding and Handling. Roadholding 
          refers to the vehicle's ability to maintain contact with the road surface, by controlling lifting movements
          along the vertical axis (z-axis), such as heave, or a rotational movement around the lateral axis (y-axis), such as pitch (Pütz, Serné, 2025).
          Handling, on the other hand, refers to the lateral dynamicis and thus describes the ability of a vehicle to
          drive around a corner quickly and stably (Pütz, Serné, 2025).

      <div id="Suspension Stiffness">
        <h3>2.1. Suspension Stiffness</h3>
        <p>
          R25e ran a high suspension spring stiffness rate of 300 lb/in (52.4 N/mm) at both axles.
          High spring rates are typically used to reduce body roll and improve responsiveness during cornering, 
          sacrificing the vehicle's roadholding capabilities. Typically for a FSAE Michigan competition track, the conditions
          are smooth and well-maintained, allowing for the use of stiffer suspension setups. However, in the case of R25e, 
          the high spring rates may have contributed to the handling issues. To better understand the impact of suspension stiffness,
          I will be analysing on suspension roll dynamics.

            subtitle="Image 11: Roll Diagram (Rouelle, n.d.)"></image-component><br>
            <p> 
              During cornering, the centrifugal force acting on the vehicle center of gravity causes the vehicle 
              to roll about its roll center. This roll motion results in the compression of the suspension on the outer wheels
              (bump travel) and the extension of the suspension on the inner wheels (droop travel). Once the limit of suspension 
              travel is reached, the inner wheel will lift off the ground, resulting in a loss of traction and stability.
            </p>

            <p>
              After performing calculations on the suspension spring compression. It was found that the 300 lb/in 
              suspension springs were only compressing by 10.223 mm under static loading conditions. That results 
              in a 10.223 mm available droop travel and a remaining 46.777 mm of bump travel. The total stroke is
              57 mm, which is the maximum travel of the Ohlins TTX25 MKll shock absorbers used in R25e and R26e.

            <p>
              The data above represents the damper travel of the left and right rear tyres during the competition skidpad event.
              From the plot, droop travel is represented by positive damper travel values, while bump travel is represented by 
              negative damper travel values. It is evident that the damper travels an estimated maximum of 8 mm in bump travel while
              it can only travel a maximum of 6 mm in droop travel. Not much can be inferred from this plot since the 
              car was not driven hard enough to visualise any anomalies in the damper travel. Hence, I will be analysing
              the damper travel during autocross, where the car was driven more aggressively.
            </p>
            <image-component tag="image" source="assets/AutoX Competition linear pod.png"
            subtitle="Image 13: Damper travel of Left and Right Rear Tyres vs Average Lateral Acceleration during Competition Autocross Event"></image-component><br>
            <p>
              From the competition autocross data above, we can see that the droop travel for both left and right rear tyres
              is blocked by an invisible line at 6 mm of damper travel, whereas the bump travel is hitting an estimated maximum of 12
              mm of damper travel. This indicates that the suspension droop travel limit is at 6 mm, and the limit of 
              the damper travel has been hit for both autocross and skidpad events. This is a clear indication that the suspension
              setup is too stiff, causing the inner wheel to lift off the ground during cornering as the damper is unable to
              extend any further.

        <h3>2.2. Final Conclusion - Suspension Stiffness</h3>
        <p>
          This is a tricky topic to conclude, as the trade-offs of changing suspension stiffness are very
          significant to the handling and roadholding characteristics of the vehicle. From the analysis above,
          it is evident that the inner tyre is lifting off the ground during cornering due to the limited droop 
          travel of the suspension.
        </p>
        <image-component tag="image" source="assets/Dyanmic Tyre Load Changes.jpg"
            subtitle="Image 14: Dyanmics Tyre Load Changes Effects on Overall Lateral Grip (Frömming, 2023)"></image-component><br>
        <p>
          In theory when dynamic load changes occur, it is expected that the overall lateral grip of the axle will
          decrease due to the non-linear characteristics of tyre grip. As shown in the image above, when a 4 kN of
          load difference occurs, the lateral force at that axle decreases against the ideal average lateral force
          when there is no load difference between left and right tyre. For a racing car, it is expected to keep
          the wheel load changes that occur as low as possible to achieve the best driving performance (Frömming, 2023).
          When the inner wheel lifts off the ground, it results in 100% load transfer on that axle.
        </p>
        <p>
          In rally cars, it is common practice to lift the inner rear wheel off the ground during hard cornering. 
          For a Front Wheel Drive (FWD) car, this technique is used to maximise the 
          traction of the driven wheels by lifting the inner rear wheel off the ground, allowing the outer rear wheel 
          to overload and yaw the car. However, for a Rear Wheel Drive (RWD) car like R25e and R26e, it is unclear
          the effects of lifting the inner rear wheel off the ground.
        </p>
        <p>
          For the R26e, the suspension spring rates will be reduced to 225 lb/in (39.3 N/mm) at the front and 200 lb/in 
          (34.9 N/mm) at the rear. This change is expected to increase the droop travel of the suspension, allowing
          for more droop travel allowance for dynamic events. For the difference in spring rates,
          the front suspension will be stiffer for more turn-in response in corners and control oversteer characteristics
          during bumps. The rear suspension will be relatively softer to increase mechanical grip and 
          minimise contact patch variation, which is important for the driven wheels. However, the drawbacks of 
          softening both front and rear axles are increased body roll during cornering and reduced responsiveness,
          which changes the handling of the car drastically.
        </p>
        <p>
          Thorough testing and validation are required before we can assess whether this modification effectively 
          minimises lateral acceleration variations observed during the skidpad event and improves vehicle handling 
          performance.

          The steering assembly can be analysed from the rack and pinion mechanism above. The steering torque from the 
          driver overcomes the resistive torque from the tyre-road interaction and the frictional losses in the steering 
          system.

          <p>
            The steering torque equation above represents the resistive load that the driver must overcome to maintain
            a constant steering angle in a corner. From the equation, we can see that the resistive torque is directly proportional 
            to the generalised steering ratio (i). This value (i) is inversely proportional to the steering ratio (SR) of the vehicle, 
            which is defined as the ratio between the steering wheel angle and the road wheel angle. The other components of the
            equation represent the tyre forces and geometry.

          <p>
            From Table 2, I will be focusing on the steering ratio (SR) and the King-Pin Inclination angle (σ) as the main factors that
            changed between R25e and R26e. The other parameters are changes due to packaging constraints and engineering 
            trade-offs outside of the steering system, and thus will not be discussed in this analysis.

              <p>
                From Table 2, the steering ratio (SR) of R26e is higher than R25e, increasing from 4.577 to 4.902 on the inner wheel, and
                from 4.644 to 6.213 on the outer wheel. This change in steering ratio results in a decrease in the generalised 
                steering ratio (i), leading to a reduction in the resistive steering torque that the driver must overcome.

                The steering ratio (SR) is obtained from the OptimumKinematics software, which is used for suspension 
                and steering kinematics. The plot above in red is the steering ratio of R26e which is greater than the 
                steering ratio of the R25e. The graph is plotted over a range of steering motion from 0° to 120° steering wheel input
                and the steering ratio is averaged over the left and right wheels.

              <p>
                Apart from steering ratio, the King-Pin Inclination angle (σ), also plays a significant role in the steering
                resistive torque. From Table 1, we can see that the King-Pin Inclination angle (σ) has decreased from 
                11.7° in R25e to 8° in R26e.

              <p>
                The vertical force component (Fz) acting on lateral inclination angle/ King-Pin Inclination angle (σ), results
                in a sine angle force component (Fz x sinσ), which nominally acts laterally on the moment arm, scrub radius (s)
                multiplied by sine of steering angle (sinδ). This moment is initially zero at zero steering angle and increases
                the resistive torque as the steering angle increases (Gillespie, 2021). 
              </p>
              <p>
                From a suspension geometry perspective, introducing high King-Pin Inclination angle (σ) will increase the lift 
                or jacking effect during cornering on both tyres (Derek, 2015). This jacking effect is felt by the driver as 
                an additional steering torque needed to lift an effective component of the vehicle's weight as steering angle 
                increases.

        <h3>2.4. Final Conclusion - Steering Torque Analysis</h3>
        <p>
          For this iteration of R26e, I aimed for a steering ratio (SR) that is approximately in the range of R25e and
          R24e to balance between steering responsiveness and steering effort. From the comments of the drivers over
          the three batches, despite the fatigue from the endurance event, they were content with the steering
          responsiveness due to the high steering ratio (SR) implemented. 
        </p>
        <p>
          For R26e, a different approach was taken to raise Ackermann percentage by inducing a higher difference in 
          steering ratio (SR) between the inner and outer wheels. The effect of this change is uncertain until
          testing and validation is done, but it is expected to improve the turn-in response of the FSAE car during
          cornering as the Ackermann effect is significant in racing series with low cornering speeds (Milliken, Milliken, 1995).
        </p>
        <p>
          As for King-Pin Inclination angle (σ), I am addressing the heavy steering feedback at low speeds. Corners
          that require low speeds tend to be hairpins in the FSAE track that require significant steering input.
          By reducing the King-Pin Inclination angle (σ), the jacking effect during cornering is reduced, leading to
          a lighter steering effort for the driver.
        </p>
        <p>
          All in all, after calculating the steering moment needed to overcome the resistive torque from the tyre-road 
          interaction, the normalised steering torque for R26e is approximately 77.3% of R25e. The assumptions made
          are that the tyre forces and moments remain the same between R25e and R26e, which is reasonable since 
          both cars used the same tyre compound and size. However, the accuracy can be improved by conducting physical 
          testing and improving our tyre model to produce combined slip characteristics that are more representative of
          a real FSAE car.
        </p>
        <p>
          The biggest change was the steering ratio (SR), which will reduce the steering responsiveness of the car.
          The trade-off is worth the risk to improve the precision of driver inputs during long stints.
        </p>
        <p>
          By addressing the steering feedback, I am directly reducing driver fatigue during long endurance stints.
          This will allow the driver to maintain better control over the car and make more precise inputs, leading to
          improved handling and lap times.

          According to the timeline above, majority of my testing and validation work will be done during Feb-26 to
          May-26. I will be conducting various tests to validate the changes made to the suspension design and steering

          studied to identify potential failure points before manufacturing and assembly.
